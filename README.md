# CPE301-FinalLab

Authors: James Acacio, Arvind Pagidi, Elijah Gutierrez

## Abstract

This lab describes the design and implementation of a working swamp cooler system to explore how temperature regulation behaves under different conditions. The hardware integrates a water-level detector, a DHT11 humidity sensor and a separate temperature probe, alongside an LCD display with push-buttons and indicator LEDs. Actuation is handled by a DC motor and an Adafruit gear-reduced stepper, all coordinated by an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller that manages sensing, user interaction and control.
